## To get started

Open this project in makecode arcade by clicking the button

This is based on the simple-platformer tutorial found in the <a href="https://arcade.makecode.com/--skillmap" target="_blank">skillmap</a>

I suggest having the skillmap open in one tab and the github project in another tab

The reason I would like you to do it this way is I can see the code you are working on and help you more easily

If you just complete the tutorial normally I will not see your code

You also make a completely different game and use Javascript if you like
